# API Documentation

This is the documentation of the API.

## Authorization

This ist easy. ðŸ˜Š The server does the authorization for you completely, as long as your application supports cookies. On each API endpoint call, the server checks if a user id has been assigned and assigns a new one if not. With this cookie the user authorizes himself.
